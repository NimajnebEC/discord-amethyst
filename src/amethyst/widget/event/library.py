If the message is found in the message cache, it can be accessed via RawMessageUpdateEvent.cached_message.
The cached message represents the message before it has been edited.
For example, if the content of a message is modified and triggers the on_raw_message_edit() coroutine,
the RawMessageUpdateEvent.cached_message will return a Message object that represents the message before the content was modified.
